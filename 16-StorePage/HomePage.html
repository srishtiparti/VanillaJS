    <h2>About US </h2>
    <p>Jack Wholesale store was founded in 1997 on February 5th in Toronto. That day a Jack saw a child sitting outside a store in snow, desperate to get heat. Jack Dawson, who survived titanic disaster and 1947 hiroshima bombing wanted to help the child.
        He bought the store so that the dog can stay in. He turned the store into a heaven of good quality clothes. However, due to high price, the bussiness was low. To overcome this problem, Jack started selling the products at really low price. Since
        then the aim is to sell all products at wholesale. The child, Jack Dawson Jr, is now trying to continue his legacy.
