                    My name is Srishti Parti. I've lived in India for the most part of my life but been living in Ontario, Canada for past 1.5 year. Initially scared of coding, I remember looking for reasons to procastinate my work and assignment. One day I was writing code
                    for a simple website and boom! my curiosity was ignited. I have 1 year experience in TCS as middleware integration developer. I used to work on IBM tool kit to integrate different platforms. I completed my certificate in Computer Application
                    Development from Conestoga College, Ontario in Janurary, 2022. And now I'm actively seeking for exciting opportunities to display my flair, enhance my skills and learn new things.

                    It's exciting, competitive and challenging. It's a work of art. It requires you to communicate with users who don't understand your language. It is something that I'm good at and I know with right opportunities, I will become better. Also, at the end
